# Sensibo plugin for Scrypted

This plugin adds support for Sensibo devices to Scrypted, using the Sensibo cloud API. The 'Climate React' system is optionally supported and is used to implement the 'HeatCool' thermostat mode, which automatically adjusts the air conditioner settingsto keep temperatures fixed within a specific temperature range.

In order to use this plugin, an API key must be obtained from 'https://home.sensibo.com/me/api' for the account to which the Sensibo device is registered.
